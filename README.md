# Project Objective and Process Summary

This is a personally coded website I made in 2022 using Visual Studio Code. My goal was to create a simple one-page website about myself, not focusing on communicating any weighty or intensive content, but to demonstrate my HTML/CSS proficiency for prospective employers/recruiters and let this project serve as an opportunity to grow and solidify my web design/development skillset. I have created two versions ("Retro" first, and then "Modern") of a personal website with slight differences in HTML code and more significant differences in CSS code, to showcase more than one design example. Self-education websites such as W3Schools and Skillshare served as helpful guides throughout the experience in terms of researching to identify sources/causes of syntax errors, correcting syntax errors, and learning new syntax.

# Project Screenshots and Design Explanations

I searched for and abided by a color palette involving the theme of "Modern" or "Contemporary", with a two-color focus in mind of black and purple, to aid me in element color decision-making. I offer the reader icon links for the different ways to contact me. Each icon has a hover effect implemented which brings the icons' color opacities up, to establish visual interest. I selected two clean, simple Sans-serif-style fonts to use - one for body text and one for heading text.

I implemented a welcome message and an About Me paragraph that I also use on my portfolio website and Linkedin profile. I wanted the core body of my website to focus on my portfolio works, and so I established a table of cells with accompanying images and descriptions that link to my portfolio's different category pages.

I utilized a mockup photo generator to select device and frame templates and plug in screenshots of my own portfolio pieces. I did this to create engaging visual previews to get across the type of work I want to do and highlight some of what is seen on my portfolio website. To create visual interest, I implemented a hover effect on the three cells containing the links, which makes a thick, all-around border appear on a cell upon hover.

The footer contains a message that links back to this README document, and a statement of copyright.
